"Always follow proper color usage in the Maktabah Ruwaq Jawi app. Accent colors like 0xFF00BF6D must never be used as large backgrounds. Keep backgrounds neutral (white, gray, or soft tones) for readability. Apply the 60-30-10 rule: 60% neutral colors for backgrounds, 30% secondary colors for surfaces, and 10% accent colors for highlights, buttons, or important icons. Maintain shadcn style: clean, minimal, balanced, and professional."
"Always apply rounded corners based on context in the Maktabah Ruwaq Jawi app. Cards and primary buttons should use larger rounded corners (xl–2xl) for a modern and friendly feel. Secondary or tertiary buttons should use medium rounding (md). Admin panels or data-heavy UI should keep corners small (sm–md) for a clean and professional look. Never mix random radii—stay consistent with the shadcn style: soft, balanced, and minimal."
