# Fullscreen Controls Debug Test Plan

## Enhanced Debug Logging Added ✅

Saya telah menambah comprehensive debug logging untuk trace fullscreen controls issue. Sekarang kita boleh nampak exact flow dari mula sampai akhir.

## Files Modified:

### 1. `video_controls_manager.dart`
- ✅ Added detailed logging in `toggleFullscreen()` method
- ✅ Shows BEFORE/AFTER state values
- ✅ Tracks when `onStateChanged` callback is called
- ✅ Confirms `_showControls = true` is set when entering fullscreen

### 2. `content_player_screen.dart`
- ✅ Added logging in VideoControlsManager's `onStateChanged` callback
- ✅ Shows `isFullscreen` and `showControls` values when setState is triggered

### 3. `content_player_scaffold_widget.dart`
- ✅ Already has logging showing values passed to FullscreenVideoWidget

### 4. `fullscreen_video_widget.dart`
- ✅ Added logging in `build()` method
- ✅ Shows final `showControls` value used for rendering
- ✅ Confirms if controls overlay is rendered or not

## Test Steps:

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Navigate to video player:**
   - Pilih mana-mana kitab
   - Masuk ke content player screen

3. **Test fullscreen:**
   - Tap fullscreen button (atau rotate device ke landscape)
   - Observe console output

## Expected Console Output:

Bila tap fullscreen button, you should see this sequence:

```
🎬🎬🎬 toggleFullscreen CALLED
  - BEFORE: isFullscreen=false, showControls=true
  - AFTER toggle: isFullscreen=true
  ✅ ENTERED FULLSCREEN - showControls SET TO: true
  ✅ Timer cancelled, NO auto-hide
  ✅ Calling onStateChanged to trigger rebuild...
  🔔 About to call onStateChanged callback
  ✅ onStateChanged callback completed

🔔 VideoControlsManager triggered setState
   - isFullscreen: true
   - showControls: true

🎬 ContentPlayerScaffoldWidget build - isFullscreen=true, showControls=true

🎬🎬🎬 FullscreenVideoWidget build:
  - showControls: true
  - showSkipAnimation: false
  - player: EXISTS
  - videoController: EXISTS
  ✅ Rendering fullscreen with showControls=true
```

## What to Look For:

### ✅ **If controls ARE visible:**
Console will show `showControls=true` throughout the entire chain, and controls akan visible di screen.

### ❌ **If controls NOT visible:**
Check console untuk identify WHERE `showControls` becomes false:

1. **If `showControls=true` in ALL logs but controls still invisible:**
   - Issue is in rendering logic (CSS/widget tree issue)
   - Solution: Check `_buildControlsOverlay()` rendering

2. **If `showControls=false` in FullscreenVideoWidget build:**
   - Value changed between setState and widget rebuild
   - Solution: Add more logging to find where it changes

3. **If `showControls=false` in ContentPlayerScaffoldWidget:**
   - Manager has wrong value after setState
   - Solution: Check if another manager is interfering

## After Testing:

**Please copy dan share the console output** bila:
1. Before tap fullscreen
2. During fullscreen transition
3. After fullscreen entered

Dengan console output tu, saya boleh identify exact point where `showControls` value is lost atau not rendering properly.

## Current Fix Applied:

✅ `startControlsTimer()` - Won't auto-hide in fullscreen
✅ `toggleFullscreen()` - Sets `_showControls = true` when entering fullscreen
✅ Timer cancelled to prevent auto-hide
✅ Comprehensive logging added

## Next Steps Based on Results:

- **Scenario A**: `showControls=true` but not rendering → Fix rendering logic
- **Scenario B**: `showControls=false` somewhere in chain → Find where it's set to false
- **Scenario C**: setState not triggering rebuild → Add PostFrameCallback
