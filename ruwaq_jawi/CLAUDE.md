# CLAUDE.md - Maktabah App Development Guide

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Maktabah** is a mobile app providing access to Islamic educational content through a subscription-based model.

### Core Value Proposition
- Digital Islamic knowledge access (eBooks + Videos)
- Structured learning experience with categorized content
- Seamless automated payment system
- Target: University students & general public

## 📋 Project Constraints & Guidelines

### Tech Stack (FIXED)

## 💾 Database Schema Guidelines

### Core Tables Required
```sql
-- Users (Supabase Auth + Custom Fields)
users: id, email, role, created_at, subscription_status

-- Kitab Content
kitab: id, title, author, description, category_id, pdf_url, youtube_video_id, youtube_video_url, thumbnail_url, duration_minutes, created_at

-- Categories
categories: id, name, description, created_at

-- Subscriptions
subscriptions: id, user_id, plan_type, start_date, end_date, status, payment_id

-- User Saved Items
saved_items: id, user_id, kitab_id, created_at

-- Transactions
transactions: id, user_id, amount, payment_method, status, created_at
```

## 🔄 Payment Flow Requirements

### Subscription Process
1. User selects plan (1/3/6/12 months)
2. Redirect to Chip payment gateway
3. Payment success triggers:
   - Chip webhook callback to Supabase Edge Function
   - Edge Function updates subscription table
   - App unlocks all content immediately

### Payment Integration Points
- **Webhook Handling**: Supabase Edge Functions for Chip payment callbacks
- **Status Updates**: Real-time subscription status changes
- **Content Unlock**: Automatic content access management
