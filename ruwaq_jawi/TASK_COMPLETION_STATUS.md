# TASK COMPLETION STATUS - Maktabah App
## 🗄️ Database & Payment Update (Terkini)
* Tables: `subscription_plans`, `user_subscriptions`, `payments`, `webhook_logs` ditambah melalui migration `009_setup_payment_and_webhook_tables.sql`.
* Profile: `profiles.subscription_status` (auto-add jika tiada), fungsi `check_active_subscription(user_uuid)`.
* Triggers: `update_profile_subscription_status()` + `update_profile_on_subscription_change` untuk sync status profil apabila langganan berubah.
* RLS: Dihidupkan untuk `user_subscriptions`, `payments`, `webhook_logs` + polisi service role.
* Nota: Jadual lama `subscriptions`/`transactions` masih wujud — perlu keputusan penyatuan.
