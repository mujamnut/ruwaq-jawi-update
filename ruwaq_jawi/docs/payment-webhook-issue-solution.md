# Payment Webhook Issue - Solution Documentation

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

Users reported that after making payments through ToyyibPay, their subscriptions remain inactive. The payment status stays stuck in "pending" and no automatic activation occurs.

## 🔬 **Root Cause Analysis**

### Main Issue: JWT Authentication Blocking Webhooks

1. **Webhook Authentication Failure**: All ToyyibPay webhook calls to our Supabase Edge Functions were returning `401 Unauthorized` errors.

2. **Supabase Edge Functions Require JWT**: By default, Supabase Edge Functions require JWT authentication headers, but external services like ToyyibPay cannot provide these tokens.

3. **Payment Flow Breakdown**:
   - ✅ User creates payment → goes to ToyyibPay
   - ✅ User pays successfully → payment created in database as "pending"
   - ❌ ToyyibPay tries to send webhook callback → gets rejected (401 error)
   - ❌ Payment never updated to "completed"
   - ❌ Subscription never activated

### Technical Details

**ToyyibPay Webhook URL being used:**
```
https://ckgxglvozrsognqqkpkk.supabase.co/functions/v1/toyyibpay-webhook-final
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Missing authorization header"
}
```

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Manual Payment Verification System** ✅

Created a comprehensive manual payment verification system that allows users to:

- **Enter Bill Code**: Users can input their ToyyibPay bill code from payment receipt
- **Verify Payment**: System checks ToyyibPay API directly for payment status
- **Auto-Activation**: If payment is verified, automatically activates subscription
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear instructions and error handling

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `lib/features/student/screens/manual_payment_verification_screen.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/core/utils/app_router.dart` (Added route `/verify-payment`)
- `lib/features/student/screens/payment_history_screen.dart` (Added manual verification button)

### 2. **Enhanced Payment Recovery** ✅

**Payment History Screen Enhancements:**
- Added manual verification button in AppBar (search icon)
- Existing recovery button for pending payments
- Clear status indicators and user guidance

### 3. **Payment Configuration Updates** ✅

**Updated Webhook URLs:**
- `payment_config.dart` updated to use new webhook endpoint
- Webhook URL: `https://ckgxglvozrsognqqkpkk.supabase.co/functions/v1/toyyibpay-webhook-final`

### 4. **User Experience Improvements** ✅

**Clear Instructions:**
- How to find bill codes in email receipts
- Step-by-step verification process
- Success/error feedback with proper messaging

## 📋 **Current Status**

### ✅ **Completed**
1. **Manual Verification System**: Fully functional and deployed
2. **Payment Recovery**: Users can now recover stuck payments manually
3. **UI/UX Updates**: Clear navigation and instructions added
4. **Code Quality**: All changes analyzed and approved

### ⏳ **Pending (Future Enhancement)**
1. **Public Webhook Endpoint**: Still blocked by Supabase JWT requirement
   - Need alternative solution for automatic webhook processing
   - Could explore: External webhook services, different deployment approach

## 🎯 **User Instructions**

### For Users with Stuck Payments:

1. **Go to Payment History**: Profile → Payment History
2. **Click Search Icon**: Top-right corner for manual verification

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### Manual Verification Flow:
```dart
1. User enters bill code → ManualPaymentVerificationScreen

4. If successful:
   - Update payment status to "completed"
   - Create/update subscription record

5. Return success/error response to user
```

### Error Handling:
